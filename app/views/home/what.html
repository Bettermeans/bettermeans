                <h2>Item Estimation</h2>
                <p>We are offering a whole new compensation model, in which you get paid for the work you do and are evaluated by your peers.
                </p>
                <p>Here is how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Estimate the value of work items</li>
                  <li>When you start an item, you know how much it's worth</li>
                  <li>After a group of items are completed, a retrospective starts</li>
                  <li><strong>In a retrospective, you enter</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>what % of the work you think you did</li>
                      <li>what % of the work you think others did</li>
                      <li>how confident you are of your esitmate</li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Everyone is compensate based on the average they recieved</li>
                  <li>Develop a reputation of how accurately you assess</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So its actually fair. No one can park in a job and do nothing, and the people who work the hardest get paid the most – pretty awesome. 
                </p>
                <p>This is an <strong>option</strong> when you create a workstream – just select credits and you are in business.

And we will need a willingness to surrender the personal need to control—‘the closet Newtonian’ that resides in all of us.<author>Dee Hock, CEO and Founder of Visa</author></blockquote>
