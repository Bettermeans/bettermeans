          <h2>We need a new agreement of how we work together.</h2> 
          <p>How we make decisions. How we decide on who gets to work on what. And who gets paid what.</p>
          <p>
            Groups of people can work together intelligently, without getting bogged down in endless meetings, or slow decision making. No bossing needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Open source software and wikipedia</strong>, are just two examples of large groups working together efficiently without fixed heirarchy.</p>
          <p>Bettermeans lets you <strong>use the same decision-making rules, and self-organizing principles behind open source</strong> to run your project.
