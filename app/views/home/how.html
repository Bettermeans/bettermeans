          <h2>New Team Structure</h2>
                      <p>No more pyramids, job titles or direct reports. </p>
                      <p>Everyone is a member, and every member gets an equal binding vote. When people first join they are contributors. Votes are recorded, but are non-binding. This way, teams can get a sense of the crowd’s voice but ultimately the team members drive the direction of the project.</p>
                      <p>Contributors are nominated to be members, and are voted in by the core team. The core team is a subset of the members who can vote in new members.</p>
                      <p>Anyone can be nominated to any level in an open enterprise, and everyone is accountable to eachother. The result is <strong>a healthy and dynamic hierarchy replaces the rigid proscribed one.</strong></p>

                <h2>Contribution-Based Compensation</h2>
                            <p>The Open Enterprise model is a <strong>peer-managed, self-correcting, results-only work environment.</strong> No salaries, bonuses, annual-reviews, or time-tracking needed. Compensation is based on contribution, as assessed by peers.</p>
                            <p>Here is how it works:</p>
                              <p>After a group of work items is completed, a retrospective automatically starts. Each person who worked on this group of item assesses:</p>
                              <ul>
                                    <li>the percentage of the work they think they did</li>
                                    <li>the percentage of the work they think others did</li>
                                    <li>how confident they are of their esitmate</li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>Everyone is compensated based on the average assessment they recieve from their peers. A reputation matrix tracks how accurately each person assesses themselves and others over time.</p>

                <h2>Shared Values:<br>Purpose is Primary</h2>
                            <p>An Open Enterprise is a community that forms around a shared value and purpose. Agreement around a shared value or set of values is the fundamental cohesive force that binds the organization.</p><p><strong>Purpose is primary, goals secondary</strong> because as the organization moves towards a goal, new experiences may inform the group to change the goal. </p><p>The goals, therefore, must be allowed to evolve. Values change much much slower, so they become the guiding principles which determine when new goals need to be added added, and old ones altered or let go.</p>

                <h2>Order Derived from Cohesive Intent, Not Control.</h2>
                <p>Old ways of thought suggest that order only happens when one person is in control, or when an executive few make informed decisions for the entire group. This assumption ignores nature and countless situations in which order arrives out of chaos. </p>
                <p>By contrast, in an Open Enterprise, all actions arise organically and through self-motivation to further the shared values of the group. This principle is at the very heart of the Open Enterprise because self-driven action is far more powerful, efficient, and innovative than coerced action. It gives the Open Enterprise it’s sheer power to get 10 times the work done in half the time as a conventional organization.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="column span-5 left first">
          <h4>Can we still use salaries?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely. We love <a href="http://help.bettermeans.com/how-to/retrospectives">our retrospective system</a>, but understand that many people will prefer to use standard salary systems (or others) to manage compensation.</p>
          <p>The credits system is an optional module that you can turn on or off at will.</p>
          
          <h4>Is this for only volunteer-run projects?</h4>
          <p>Not at all. Our mission is help people earn right livelihood in the world.</p>
          <p>Having said that, our governance structures were heavily influenced by the open source world, and therefore work really well for volunteer run efforts.</p>
          <h4>Does everything have to be public?</h4>
          <p>Nope. We think fully public orgs are the way forward, but we understand the need for privacy. It is possible to run some (or all) of your projects as private workstreams.</p>
          <p>All members will still have access to these private project workstreams, but you can be selective about which contributors get access to them, and the general public will not be able to see them.</p>
          <h4>What kind of organization is this best for?</h4>
          <p>Social enterprises and movements. Open source software projects. Volunteer-based orgs. Content production. Knowledge-based collaboration. Event planning. And hopefully other applications that will surprise us!</p>
          
          
        </div>
        <div class="column span-5 left last">
          <h4>Is this a proven model?</h4>
          <p>Various aspects of the Open Enterprise Model have been used successfully by other organizations including Visa, Goretex, Apache Software, Wikipedia, Linux, Spain’s Mondragón Corporación Cooperitva and many others.</p><p> While such companies have pioneered these concepts with excellent results, BetterMeans is revolutionary in bringing these various techniques together in a single, cohesive model.</p>          
          <p>Leading business thinkers such as Gary Hamel and Margaret Wheately see the change in organizational design coming, and are advising companies today to embrace more self-organizing structures.</p>
          <p>The Open Enterprise model builds on their theories and research, and provides a new way for people to work together that governs all major aspects of managing a business, including capital allocation, strategic decision-making, compensation, and human resource management.</p>
          <p>We ourselves have been running as an Open Enterprise since 2009. You can <a href="http://secure.bettermeans.com/projects/bm">checkout our project page here</a></p>
