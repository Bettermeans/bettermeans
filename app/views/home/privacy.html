            <p>BetterMeans is committed to securing the privacy of survey data and of keeping email addresses and other identifying information confidential.  Below is privacy information relevant to survey creators and administrators, for people who take surveys on BetterMeans, and or people who volunteer to be invited to participate in future research.  There is also a statement researchers can cut and paste to include in Internal Review Board approval applications.</p>



            <a name='privacycreators'></a><h2>For Survey Creators and Administrators</h2>



            <p>When you create a new BetterMeans account, we collect several pieces of information about you.</p>



            <a name='privacycreatoremail'></a><h3>Your Name and Email Address</h3>



            <p>To insure that the email address you provide is actually yours, we require you to activate a new account by clicking on a link in an email sent to the email address you provide for us.  You are free to change the email address associated with your account at any time, but you will once again have to activate the new email address by clicking a link in an email sent to the new address.  We will never give or sell your email address to anyone, and we will use it only to communicate with you about your BetterMeans account.  If you choose to send out email invitations to your survey via the BetterMeans invitations page, however, all emails that you send will include both the name and the email address you provide to us in the From field of the email.  The Sender field of the email will read "surveyinvitation@BetterMeans.org", since BetterMeans is sending the email on your behalf, but the email will appear to come from you, and anyone receiving an invitation will have your email address.</p>



            <a name='privacycreatoruse'></a><h3>Institutional Affiliation and Intended Use</h3>



            <p>We ask you to provide your institutional affiliation (if any) and a brief description of your intended use of BetterMeans.  We use this information to help insure that you are using BetterMeans for valid research purposes in line with mission of BetterMeans.  We will not share this information with anyone.  We may, in addition, inspect the surveys you are designing in order to insure that you are using BetterMeans for research purposes.  Your surveys are your own, however, and we will respect the privacy of your survey design.  Once we can determine that you are using the site for legitimate purposes, you will be manually approved to send email invitations to your survey via the invitations page.</p>



            <a name='privacycreatorparticipants'></a><h3>Survey Participants</h3>



            <p>You may choose to input information about prospective survey participants on the participants page.  This information, including names or email addresses of participants, will be stored in a secure database.  Only you will have access to participants' identifying information.  Though BetterMeans staff can view this information, we will not review it unless you are asking us for help with a problem that required us to, and we will not use it for any purpose.</p>



            <p>It is up to you to decide whether your surveys are accessible to anyone or only to people you invite to take the survey.  By clicking the "Require Login ID" box on your survey's properties page, only individuals with a login ID will be able to access your survey.  You can either create a list of login IDs to distribute yourself or email invitations to participants via the invitations page to automatically include login IDs in the 
            </p>



            <a name='privacycreatordata'></a><h3>Security and Confidentiality of Data</h3>



            <p>The data you collect via your surveys will be stored in a secure database.  See the IRB statement below for more security details.  To prevent the possibility that data will be intercepted as it travels the internet, all data is encrypted in transmission, both when participants fill out surveys and when you view or download your data.  You may notice, when you are on the data page of BetterMeans, that the web address in your browser starts with "HTTPS".  The "S" on the end stands for "secure" and indicates that the web page is encrypted.  Your web browser will also show a symbol, usually a closed padlock, indicating that you are on a secure web page.</p>



            <p>While the database in which your data is stored is as secure as can be arranged, please keep in mind that all information stored on web servers is vulnerable.  Hackers work to outwit security measures as fast as security experts work to keep hackers out.  If you have concerns about your data remaining online, you can always delete it from BetterMeans once you have downloaded it.  That said, keeping your data on BetterMeans provides a convenient backup for you should anything happen to your data wherever you store it locally.  The bottom line is that your data is well secured, but always potentially vulnerable, and it is up to you to decide whether to keep your data online.  Though BetterMeans staff do have the ability to view any data you collect, we will never do so unless you ask us to for purposes of helping you solve a problem.</p>



            <p>The greatest risk to the security of your data is someone exploiting the password you use to log in to your BetterMeans account.  You can minimize this risk by using a hard to guess password.  The best passwords are long, mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers, and don't include words that can be found in the dictionary.  The home page, where you enter your password, is encrypted to prevent passwords being intercepted.  You should also be cautious about where you store your passwords and who you share them with.</p>



            <p>Staff at BetterMeans have the ability to view your data, but we will never do so unless you ask us to so that we can help you with a technical problem.  You are the owner of your data, and we will never make use of it for any reason.</p>



            <a name='privacyIRB'></a><h2>For Internal Review Boards</h2>



            <p>Please feel free to cut and paste the statement below for use in IRB application forms.</p>



            <p>BetterMeans was created to provide psychologists and other social science researchers with the ability to conduct survey research on the web for free.  </p>



            <p>BetterMeans is committed to keeping all participant data secure and confidential.  As is true with all survey websites, BetterMeans administrators have the ability to view confidential participant data.  We will never do so, however, unless the survey creator asks us to so that we may help them with a technical problem.  Survey creators have the option to make surveys anonymous, divorcing all of a participant's identifying information from their survey responses, though it is up to the individual researcher to decide whether a given survey will be anonymous.  </p>



            <p>All data is stored in a password protected database at a web hosting site that provides top of the line virtual and physical security. The web hosting facilities make use of firewalls, real-time security alerting using intrusion detection scanners, and 24-hour monitoring from their network operations center.  The website itself is safeguarded against common hacker tricks.  Physical security of database servers includes perimeter fencing, green field space, card access, biometric entries, and mantraps, 24-hour security guards and continuous camera surveillance inside and outside the facility's buildings.  </p>



            <p>To prevent the possibility that data will be intercepted as it travels the internet, all data is encrypted in transmission using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), both when survey participants fill out surveys and when survey creators download their data.  Survey creators are free to delete data from the BetterMeans online database at any time, though many choose to keep their data online as a convenient backup location.</p>



            <a name='privacyparticipants'></a><h2>For Survey Participants</h2>



            <a name='privacypartemail'></a><h3>Emails from BetterMeans</h3>



            <p>Any survey researcher who creates an account on BetterMeans is free to input a list of names and email addresses of potential survey participants.  If you received an email invitation to participate in a survey on BetterMeans, it is because the creator of the survey entered your email on their survey participant list.  BetterMeans will never use your email for any purpose and will never sell or give it to anyone else.  BetterMeans does keep its own list of emails for people who are interested in participating in surveys, but unless you deliberately signed up to participate in future surveys, we do not have your email on our list.</p>



            <p>You are free at anytime to add yourself to our "Do Not Email" list.  This will prevent anyone from being able to send you an invitation to a BetterMeans survey in the future.  There are two ways to put yourself on the list.  You can go to <a href='http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php'>http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php</a> and enter your email.  You can also click on the link at the bottom of every invitation you receive from BetterMeans.  Doing either of these things will immediately prevent any future email inivtations from coming to your email from BetterMeans.  If you accidentally put yourself on our "Do Not Email" list and would like to be removed from it (so that you can receive survey invitations), you can also do this at <a href='http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php'>http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php</a>.</p>



            <a name='privacypartdata'></a><h3>Security and Confidentiality of Survey Responses</h3>



            <p>When you fill out a survey, the information you fill in is encrypted before it is sent to BetterMeans to protect against the possibility of the information being intercepted as it travels the internet.  All survey data is stored in a secure database.  The data is the owned by the person who created the survey you took, and they are responsible for the disposition of the data.  Most researchers include a statement at the beginning of the survey about what they will do to insure your data remains confidential.  If there is no such statement, and if you are concerned about confidentiality, feel free to email the researcher who sent you the invitation before filling out the survey.  While BetterMeans will never use your data for any reason, we cannot control what happens to the data once it has been downloaded by the person who created the survey.</p>



            <p>When you begin a survey, you are automatically assigned a login ID, a random 10 character string of letters and numbers.  This login ID allows you to return to a survey later that is only partially filled out.  Because you cannot go back to a survey page that has already been filled out, this also means that no one else, even if they have your login ID, can go back and view data you have already entered.  Pressing the back button on your web browser, however, will take you back to previous pages where your data was filled in, so if you are on a public terminal, make sure to close the web browser after you are done with the survey.</p>



            <a name='privacyvolunteers'></a><h2>For Survey Volunteers</h2>



            <a name='privacyvolemail'></a><h3>Emails from BetterMeans</h3>



            <p>A survey volunteer is someone who has volunteered to be invited to participate in future surveys.  Survey volunteers sign up in one of two ways.  Either you enter your email on the final page of a survey or you enter it in the "Sign up to take surveys" box on the email management page: <a href='http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php'>http://www.BetterMeans.org/addremove.php</a>.  Once you have entered your email, you are required to confirm your ownership of the email address you entered by clicking on a link in a survey invitation in the email sent to that address.  This takes you to a short survey collecting demographic information about volunteers.</p>



            <p>Once we have your email on our volunteers list, we may send you email invitations from time to time asking if you want to participate in a future survey.  You may choose to respond to or ignore each of these emails, and if you want to take your email off the volunteer list, there is a link at the bottom of every invitation that you can use to do so.  Invitations are sent to you when a researcher asks BetterMeans to send invitations to a certain number of people matching characteristics they specify (a certain gender, a certain age range, living in a certain country, etc.).  BetterMeans then sends out the invitations.  The researcher is not given your email directly.  We will never give or sell your email address to anyone or use it for any other purpose besides to send you invitations to participate in surveys.</p>
