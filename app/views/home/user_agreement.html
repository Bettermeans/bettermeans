        <h2>OPEN ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>
        This Agreement is a legal agreement between You ("You") and the other Open Enterprise Participants (as defined below) of the Open Enterprise (as defined below) that You join as a Open Enterprise Participant, with respect to the work that You, together with these other Open Enterprise Participants, perform for that Open Enterprise. This Agreement sets forth the licenses You grant, and certain obligations You have, to other Open Enterprise Participants regarding Your contributions to the Open Enterprise and sets forth certain rights You have as a Open Enterprise Participant of the Open Enterprise regarding contributions of other Open Enterprise Participants. You must accept the terms of this Agreement before participating in the Open Enterprise or contributing any Open Enterprise Contribution (as defined below), or before receiving any Open Enterprise Contributions from other Open Enterprise Participants.
</p>
        <h2>OPEN ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE</h2>
        <p>

        This Agreement sets forth the legal terms under which You participate in the Open Enterprise. This Agreement is based on the Open Enterprise Governance Model:
</p>        <p>

        Under the principle of Open Enterprise Governance, every Open Enterprise Participant can be part of the decision-making processes that affect the Open Enterprise and such Open Enterprise Participant's contribution to the Open Enterprise. This participation in the decision-making processes of the Open Enterprise can be exercised by voting. The Open Enterprise Governance is defined below.
</p>        <p>

        Individually and collectively, the Open Enterprise Governance Model is aimed at creating a framework or fairness, within which the Open Enterprise Participants will cooperate to achieve the Open Enterprise Result through providing their individual contributions.
</p>

        <h2>AGREEMENT:</h2>

        <h2>1. Open Enterprise STRUCTURE; JOINING A Open Enterprise.</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Open Enterprise.</h3>
<p>
        A "Open Enterprise" is a development Open Enterprise organized and managed through the BetterMeans.com website that has at least one Open Enterprise Participant, has a purpose stated on the BetterMeans.com website, and has a unique Open Enterprise ID on the BetterMeans.com website .
</p>
        <h3>1.2 Open Enterprise Result.</h3>
<p>
        The stated purpose of a Open Enterprise is called a "Open Enterprise Result." The Open Enterprise Result can be a product, software, service, or other goal that the Open Enterprise Assembly (as defined below) for an Open Enterprise decides to pursue. The Open Enterprise Assembly for a Open Enterprise may change and further refine a Open Enterprise Result from time to time.
</p>
        <h3>1.3 Open Enterprise Governance.</h3>
<p>
        This Agreement describes some of the terms governing Open Enterprises, but You should review the Open Enterprise Governance Model and Open Enterprise-related pages of the BetterMeans.com website for more details. Each Open Enterprise is governed by the Open Enterprise Assembly for that Open Enterprise, in accordance with this Agreement and the Open Enterprise Governance Model for the BetterMeans.com website . The "Open Enterprise Assembly" is the collective of all Open Enterprise Participants, which collectively can make binding decisions for the Open Enterprise. The Open Enterprise Assembly makes binding decisions for the Open Enterprise through a voting process that is further described and defined in the Open Enterprise Governance Model (this process is referred to as "Voting"), except to the extent otherwise decided by the Open Enterprise Assembly through Voting prior to a decision.
</p>
        <h3>1.4 Open Enterprise Participants.</h3>
<p>
        Each Open Enterprise is undertaken by one or more Open Enterprise Participants. A "Open Enterprise Participant" means, for any Open Enterprise, (a) You, if You have satisfied all of the conditions set forth in Section 1.5 for that Open Enterprise or (b) another person who has satisfied such conditions for participation set forth in the Software Bill of Rights Agreement entered into by such person for the applicable Open Enterprise. A "Software Bill of Rights Agreement" means an agreement substantially similar to this Agreement, or any prior or subsequent version of this Agreement published by [the hosting agent].
