Hey <%= @name %>,
<br>
<br>I saw that you just signed up for our site. Thanks for trying us out.
<br>
<br>We've been building bettermeans and the open enterprise model for almost two years now, and we're just beginning to share it with a wider audience.
<br>This is more than a business for us, we're pretty serious about making a positive shift in the world, and need all the help we can get.
<br>
<br>Needless to say, we are psyched to see how you will be using bettermeans, and would love your feedback/ideas/suggestions.
<br>
<br>Please call or write if you have any feedback, or if there's anything that's unclear that you need help with. 
<br>
<br>Thanks!
