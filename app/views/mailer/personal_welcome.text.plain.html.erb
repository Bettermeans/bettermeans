Hey <%= @name %>,

I just saw that you signed up for our site. Thanks for trying us out.

We've been building bettermeans and the open enterprise model for almost two years now, and we're just beginning to share it with a wider audience.
This is more than a business for us, we're pretty serious about making a positive shift in the world, and need all the help we can get.

Needless to say, we are psyched to see how you will be using bettermeans, and would love your feedback/ideas/suggestions.

Please call or write if you have any feedback, or if there's anything that's unclear that you need help with. 

Thanks!

p.s. if you run into any bugs, or have a new feature that you think we should implement, you can directly add it on our platform workstream here:
