Hey <%= @name %>,

I saw that you just signed up for our site. Thanks for trying us out.

We've been building bettermeans and the open enterprise model for
almost two years now, and we're just beginning to share it with a
wider audience.

If you have any questions at all, need a hand with anything, or would
like to arrange for a demo - don't hesitate to email us at support@bettermeans.com.

You can also find some useful information to help get you started here http://help.bettermeans.com

Thanks!
