= S3 plugin for Redmine

== Description
This Redmine[http://www.redmine.org] plugin makes file attachments be stored on Amazon S3 rather than on the local filesystem.

== Installation
1. Make sure Redmine is installed and cd into it's root directory
2. git clone git://github.com/tigrish/redmine_s3.git vendor/plugins/redmine_s3
3. cp vendor/plugins/redmine_s3/config/s3.yml.example config/s3.yml
4. Edit config/s3.yml with your favourite editor
5. Restart mongrel/upload to production/whatever

== Options
* The bucket specified in s3.yml will be created automatically when the plugin is loaded (this is generally when the server starts).
* If you have created a CNAME entry for your bucket set the cname_bucket option to true in s3.yml and your files will be served from that domain. 
* After files are uploaded they are made public. This seems acceptable as it is also Redmine's policy for file storage.
