SSL Requirement
===============

SSL requirement adds a declarative way of specifying that certain actions
should only be allowed to run under SSL, and if they're accessed without it,
they should be redirected.

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SslRequirement
  end

  class AccountController < ApplicationController
    ssl_required :signup, :payment
    ssl_allowed :index
    
    def signup
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end
    
    def payment
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end

    def index
      # This action will work either with or without SSL
    end

    def other
      # SSL access will be redirected to non-SSL
    end
  end
  
You can overwrite the protected method ssl_required? to rely on other things
than just the declarative specification. Say, only premium accounts get SSL.

P.S.: Beware when you include the SslRequirement module. At the time of
inclusion, it'll add the before_filter that validates the declarations. Some
times you'll want to run other before_filters before that. They should then be
declared ahead of including this module.
