- Migrate to hostable / software As Service Model
- Segment each "Open Enterprise" (a.k.a Project ) on its own domain
	- by default, have each open enterprise on a subdomain, e.g. soederpop.bettermeans.com
	- each open enterprise can configure a unique tld e.g. soederpop.com.  
	- Determine which "Open Enterprise" by parsing host from Rails Request

- noticed a few places where session state was part of the model (e.g. @user.logged?, @user.roles_for_project )
	- i do not think this is optimal
	
- Replace current User Authentication scheme with Authlogic plugin

- Replace current Attachment class with Paperclip plugin
- Introduce Squirrel for cleaner find operations on ActiveRecord 

- Introduce Juggernaut for Server-Side Push.  Replace polling mechanism for dashboard
	- have things like mail messages, notifications, etc immediately pushed to the browser without polling, refreshing, etc
	- refresh activity feeds, dashboard, etc
