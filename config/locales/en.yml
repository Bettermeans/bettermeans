  help_how_do_i_join_a_team_description : "There are two levels of team membership: Contributor, and Core Team. <br /><br /><strong>Becoming a contributor</strong><br />Before getting on a core team you must first contribute to the team. </br>You become a contributor for a workstream by requesting and getting ownership of an existing tasks. <br /> Another way to become a contributor, is to be a core team member of any sub workstream.<br /><br /><strong>Become a core team member</strong><br />Once you are a contributor, you may request (or be invited) to join the Core Team by an existing Core Team member. <br /><br /> You can also join a workstream's core team directly if your a core team member of its parent workstream."
  help_core_points_title : Core Points
  help_core_points_description : "Core points are a way of team members endorsing each other, and signaling confidence in each other's abilities and core values. <br /><br /> When someone on a core team feels that the team is better off with someone on it they can give that person a core point. It also works the other way: If someone feels that someone is hurting the team, they can give them a negative-core point. <br /><br />When a member's total core points exceeds zero, they're invited to be on the core team. If their total falls below zero, they revert back to contributor status. <br /><br />All voting is confidential to minimize internal politics as much as possible.<br />Total core points is calculated by adding up the votes of existing core team members of a workstream and its parent."
  help_dpp: Items in a workstream are estimated in credits.<br/><br/>Each workstream has a different scale for possible estimations. The scale varies based on the complexity/granulatiry of the type of work for that workstream.

More weight is given to the more recent retrospectives, and more weight is given to retrospectives with more credits.<br><br>For example: A postive self assessment accuracy score of +7 means the user tends to overrate themselves by 7 percentage points on average. <br><br> An 'other' assessment score of &plusmn 16 means the user tends have a total bias of plus or minus 16 percentage points when rating their peers. <br><br> The closer both these numbers are to zero, the more accurate the user is in their assessment of self and other. "
  help_your_assessment: "<strong>Your assessment</strong><br>Your view of how much you and your team mates contributed to the execution of the items completed in this retrospective overall.

  help_final_assessment: "All the Team averages are used to be proportionally distributed over 100%"
  help_confidence: "<strong>Assessment confidence</strong><br>Adjust this slider depending on how confident you are of your assessment of yourself and your peer.<br>Lower confidence, means your ratings will be given less weight, and your self assessment index will be less impact by team-self discrepancies."

  help_issue_tracking: "This is the essential element of the platform in that it allows you to track all work items using the dashboard and item views. However one situation in which you might turn this off is if you are creating a root workstream for your organization and you are planning on creating lots of subworkstreams where all the work and item tracking would take place.
