It also works the other way: If someone feels that someone is hurting the team, they can give them a negative-core point. <br /><br />When a member's total core points exceeds zero, they're invited to be on the core team. If their total falls below zero, they revert back to contributor status. <br /><br />All voting is confidential to minimize internal politics as much as possible.<br />Total core points is calculated by adding up the votes of existing core team members of a workstream and its parent."

  help_issue_tracking: "This is the essential element of the platform in that it allows you to track all work items using the dashboard and item views. However one situation in which you might turn this off is if you are creating a root workstream for your organization and you are planning on creating lots of subworkstreams where all the work and item tracking would take place.

    A Workstream is our lingo for a group or set of work.<br /><br /> A workstream
    could be a <strong>department</strong> of your organization or it could be a <strong>specific
    project</strong> that you are working on by your self or with others. In creating
    a workstreams there are a few important things to pay attention to:<br /><br /><ul><li>
    <strong>Public</strong>: A public workstream means that anyone can see your work
    and can comment and contribute. If you do not want to have this transparency with
    the community, you can uncheck this box and you are then creating a private workstream.
    As the creator, you control who has access, but also note that you have to pay
    for private workstreams. <a href= 'http://help.bettermeans.com/workstreams' target='blank'>
    Read more about tradeoffs. </a> </li><li> <strong>Volunteer</strong>: This is
    a signal to everyone working with you that all work in this workstream is fully
    volunteer.</li><li> <strong>Credits</strong>: Credits are a more open and democratic
    way of valuing work and awarding compensation. We are really excited about offering
    this as an option and we strongly encourage you to <a href= 'http://help.bettermeans.com/credits'
    target='blank'> learn more about credits. </a></li></ul> Still have questions,

  help_section_invitation_new: "Use invitations to enroll team members to join your workstream.<br /><br /> When you send someone an invitation, they will be prompted to create a bettermeans account (if they don't have one already), and <strong>automatically added as a contributor</strong> to your workstream.<br /><br />You can only invite people to a root workstream. Their membership in a workstream applies to all sub work streams as well. In other words,<strong> a person can't belong to a sub workstream, and not belong to its parent workstream.</strong><br /><br /> <a href='http://help.bettermeans.com/invitations' target='blank'>Learn more in our help section.</a><br /><br /><br />"

  help_section_retrospective_show: "<strong>This is a retrospective.</strong> In a retrospective compensation is awarded by your peers and your own self-assessment.
