It also works the other way: If someone feels that someone is hurting the team, they can give them a negative-core point. <br /><br />When a member's total core points exceeds zero, they're invited to be on the core team. If their total falls below zero, they revert back to contributor status. <br /><br />All voting is confidential to minimize internal politics as much as possible.<br />Total core points is calculated by adding up the votes of existing core team members of a workstream and its parent."
